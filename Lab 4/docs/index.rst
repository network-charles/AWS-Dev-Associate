=====================================================
Welcome to Docker ARP Analysis Documentation!
=====================================================

I've been immersing myself in CI/CD pipeline studies lately, and now that I've gotten a good grasp of it, I can finally dedicate my full attention to understanding container technologies. To start, I decided to focus on networking, which is the stack I'm most familiar with.
In this simple how-to guide, I'll walk you through observing the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in action within a Docker environment.
An Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) allows a container to learn the MAC address of another device (in this lab, itâ€™s the bridge and other containers) dynamically.
Without an ARP, a ping between containers, external networks, or even a web request between containers and other devices fails.
