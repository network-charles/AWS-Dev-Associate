I enjoyed these two articles from Hank Preston, a principal engineer at Cisco. The last one is from me.

- `Exploring Default Docker Networking Part 1 <https://blogs.cisco.com/learning/exploring-default-docker-networking-part-1#:~:text=With%20those%20basics%20covered%2C%20let%27s,that%20uses%20the%20bridge%20driver.>`_
- `Exploring Default Docker Networking Part 2 <https://blogs.cisco.com/learning/exploring-default-docker-networking-part-2>`_
- `A Routers Intimacy With MAC Addresses <https://charlesuneze.substack.com/p/a-routers-intimacy-with-mac-addresses>`_ (I wrote this a few years ago. It discusses ARP and ICMP in a Cisco environment.)
